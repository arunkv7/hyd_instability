abstract="For a given shear-layer geometry the high-Reynolds-numbers
  turbulent flows possess strong, stable in-the-large, nearly universal
  features associated with the large number of degrees of freedom in the
  flows. These features include a range of scales of dominant energetic
  motion, a range of operating intensity levels, and average
  three-dimensional phase relations which, together, somehow insure the
  maintenance of a self-regenerative process. In seeking a rational
  approach to the bewildering variety of transitional behavior (Ref. 1),
the author conjectures that many instability paths to turbulence are
  admissible and that their effectiveness hinges on whether the given
  mechanism supplies the proper scales, intensity level, and 3D phase
  relations needed for self-regeneration.",
